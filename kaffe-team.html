			In late 2009, John and Nate, longtime colleagues overseas, decided they should be in business together, and that business should be coffee.  They started work in Seattle&#39;s industrial district, crafting a metal filter that would fit the AeroPress beautifully and last forever.

			Through many adventures and a wildly successful product launch they noticed their own coffee buying and brewing habits were changing, too. Nate wanted more variety and less difficulty when buying bags of coffee online. John thought brewing at home didn&#39;t have to be so fussy; he was tired of all the time and detail to make a cup that didn&#39;t always even turn out well. More and more, they each wanted to enjoy their coffee&#150; which they still believed should be exceptional&#150; without having to focus on the process.

			And so they decided to move Kaffeologie into the business of roasting great coffee for the everyman. Coffee that&#39;s delicious, nuanced, and developed while also being elegantly simple. Coffee you can brew using an 8 cup auto drip. Coffee you can order at the push of a button.

			They knew they couldn't curate this experience alone&#150; they needed someone who would find the best coffees, roast them with care and help share them with the world. Enter Katherine, a longtime friend and coffee professional who had worked on all sides of the industry by that point.

			She was eager to move back to Seattle after a few cold winters in Chicago, and the promise of a new project she could also call her own was just the way to do it. She too envisioned a better experience: the most delicious coffees, the least amount of attitude. She wanted to roast and blend coffee so tasty it could speak for itself.

			And so, by hook and by crook, they found an enchanting cavern in the Chinatown International District, five amazing coffees, and got to work.
