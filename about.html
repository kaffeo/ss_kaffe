      We started roasting because we were tired of the status quo.  Kaffeologie is focused on selling coffees anyone can brew, regardless of their gear and without the attitude.  You won't find advertisements for grinders and kettles here, because we believe your morning routine shouldn't have to change for your coffee.  Instead, by asking why at every decision point, we are changing your coffee to fit the routine.  Because, really, who has time for a scale at 6am?

        We buy from importers because it's sustainable

          We seek out and purchase coffees that are beautifully unique, fully traceable, and economically and socially sustainable. 
        </p>
        <p class="body-text pad1-left pad1-right text-justify">
          We believe that improved cup quality and sustainability come from cultivating an environment of idea sharing and collaboration, and so we purchase through a group of importers we trust and respect.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text pad1-left pad1-right text-justify">
          This allows us as a small company to still support both large and small scale producers who are dedicated to long term partnerships, farm and community development, and an unwavering pursuit of quality.

          We show off our coffees by finding the best expression of their character, depth, and nuance through roast. 
        </p>
        <p class="body-text pad1-left pad1-right text-justify">
          We chase after the most complementary representation of each coffee's unique sweetness, acidity, and balance. This means we roast based on each coffee's inherent qualities rather than final color.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text pad1-left pad1-right text-justify">
          Ultimately this is a much harder process and takes time, trial and error, and very detailed note-taking. We do it because it's the only way to guarantee a coffee will taste good in a wide variety of conditions rather than only in an ideal setting.

          We blend coffees because we believe the most delicious brews are the result of deliberate collaboration rather than mindless differentiation. 
        </p>
        <p class="body-text pad1-left pad1-right text-justify">
          Single origin coffees are beautiful, and often what makes them so is their inherently unbalanced nature. Rather than roasting to hide this, we let our coffees shine through what they contribute to making each other better. 
        </p>
        <p class="body-text pad1-left pad1-right text-justify">
          We are painstakingly exact in considering their solubility and character so that each blend has greater balance and complexity, and is more delicious than its individual components.
