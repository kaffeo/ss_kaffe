      	Everyone has a favorite diner booth; this one is ours. Melted ice cream texture with notes of clementine, cashew butter, juniper, candied orange peel and a Bordeaux-like, luxuriant finish, it's complex and yet simply delicious. We designed this coffee to taste good with pie. Whether it's for breakfast or dessert is up to you.

                  Purchased through the third annual Antioquia’s Best Cup auction, this coffee comes from a small farm in an often overshadowed part of Colombia. La Maria is in the Andes municipality due south of Medellin, and is run by a second generation producing family. Everyone, from the youngest children to the grandparents, has been involved in coffee production at La Maria in one way or another.
              </p>
				<p class="body-text pad3-left pad3-right">
                  The Best Cup auction is a symbol of Antioquia’s efforts to educate its citizens, reduce violence, and promote economic prosperity. Until recently, Antioquia did not have the reputation for quality in coffee that some regions such as Cauca and Nariño do. The governor’s office has been working hard to change that on many fronts, including an educational program that helps improve quality on small farms like La Maria.
              </p>
              <p class="body-text pad3-left pad3-right">
                  
We fell in love with La Maria. Its beautiful, lime-like acidity, pleasant minerality, and rich coffee blossom sweetness made it stand out among the best in its region and hold its own on our cupping table.

                Oreti Estate has been owned by the Harries family since 1946, and today it is managed by third generation producer Boyce. Currently he oversees harvest, processing, and between-season upkeep, with the assistance of 40 permanent staff.
              </p>
				<p class="body-text pad3-left pad3-right">
                 The permanent staff is sort of an extended family, with many members also having several generations living and working at Oreti. The Harries provide homes, as well as numerous extra facilities such as a social hall, nursery school, and a homework room, while the staff form a self-elected committee which meets monthly to raise and discuss social, welfare, safety, and health matters.
              </p>
              <p class="body-text pad3-left pad3-right">
              The Harries family is extremely active in the local community around Oreti, donating more than 50 acres of land to the Thika Municipal Council and cofounding the Wabeni Technical Institute, which seeks to teach underprivileged children practical skills.
              </p>
              <p class="body-text pad3-left pad3-right">
              We chose this coffee for the social consciousness all those involved with it practice, alongside its exquisite flavor profile. It is complex, bright, and aromatic, with prominent flavors like rhubarb jam, candied grapefruit, and magnolia.
