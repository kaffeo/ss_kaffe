<h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100"> when will my coffee ship, and when will it arrive?
</h2>
<h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> We roast to order on Monday and ship on Tuesday for delivery by Friday. You'll receive a tracking number once your order ships. 
</h3>
<h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100"> how much coffee should I order?
</h2>
<h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> If you make a pot a day, you'll want about one 12 oz bag a week. If you brew by hand, one cup a day is a bout one 12 oz bag every two weeks.
</h3>
<h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100">how often do coffees change?
</h2>
  <h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> We're always on the lookout for fresh picks, and we add them to our blends whenever we find a great match.
  </h3>
</section>   
<h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100"> which coffee should I choose?
</h2>
<h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> 
  Well, that depends on what kind of coffee you like!! If you prefer bright, tropical coffees, we suggest <a href="/its-your-birthday">It's Your Birthday</a>. If you prefer drinking espresso, we suggest <a href="/diner-booth">Diner Booth</a>. If you like coffee-coffee and can't always describe specific flavors, you might like <a href="/dear-diary">Dear Diary</a>. We think each of our coffees have something to offer and if you'd like a more personalized recommendation, feel free to shoot us an <a href="/contact">email</a>.
  </h3>
<h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100"> will you grind my coffee for me?
</h2>
<h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> Because we believe in excellence at every level of service we offer, we don't currently grind coffee before shipping it. Grinding coffee has arguably the greatest impact on final cup of any step in the brewing process, and since we cannot brew alongside you and offer suggestions based on the grind, we would rather leave this step to you. 
  </h3>
<h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100"> is your coffee fair trade/organic/biodynamic/vibe certified?
</h2>
<h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> Probably the essence of this question is, do you source ethically and sustainably? The answer to this is yes, and the way in which we do so varies from coffee to coffee, because each coffee region has a different set of variables dictating what sustainability and ethical purchasing looks like. For this reason, for example, you may not see many certified organic coffees on our offer page, but you will also not see many Central American coffees in general. This is because we believe in supporting small producers who cannot always afford certification, but who use sustainable and historically traditional cultivation techniques. We are able to do this by developing relationships with importers who's business practices and ethics we respect, and by researching our coffees heavily before purchasing them.
  </h3>
<h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100"> how should I brew your coffee?
</h2>
<h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> 
  ANY WAY YOU LIKE! Of course we have preferred methods (Katherine brews a Chemex every morning, and sometimes teases Nate about his technique), but we have developed our roast and blend profiles so that they should work well with whatever method you all ready use. We believe you shouldn't have to learn a new recipe just to get it to taste good. If you would like some support around brewing specifically, shoot us an <a href="/contact">email</a> and we'll be more than happy to help!

  </h2>
  <h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100"> do I have to have a subscription, or can I just buy one bag once?
  </h2>
  <h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> 
    Either way-- you can buy how ever you prefer. We have subscriptions, and we also have single purchase options. Check out our <a href="/shop-coffee">shop page</a> for those.  
<h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100"> how do subscriptions work?
 </h2>
    <h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> 
      Basically, you pick your coffee first, and your frequency second. Check out, and you'll be billed per shipment rather than all at once. There's more information on the <a href="/subscribe">subscribe</a> page.
<h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100"> how do I manage my subscription?
</h2>
<h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> 
  Links to manage your subscription are in every emailed receipt. From there you can log in to your account, edit your coffee, your billing information, or even just cancel. We're currently working on adding a login on our home page, but in the meanwhile if you lose your receipt or need help just shoot us an <a href="/contact">email</a>.
</h3>
<h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100">can I give a subscription to someone else?
  </h2>
<h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> 
Great idea! Check out our gift subscriptions <a href="/gift-subscriptions">here</a>. More info about gift subscriptions below.

<p id="gift-subscriptions"><h2 class="heading2 text-left border1-bottom color10-bdr margin2-bottom margin2-top width100">Gift Subcriptions</h2>
<h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100"> how do gift subscriptions work?
</h2>
<h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> 
Gift subscriptions can be purchased in 1, 3, 6, and 12 month increments. For these, you pay up front for the entire subscription, and receive a nominal discount for doing so. A 12 oz bag of coffee along with a handwritten note is sent every two weeks for the duration of the subscription. 
</h3>
<h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100"> what information do I need to set up a gift subscription?
        </h2>
        <h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> 
You will need your billing information and your lucky recipient's name and address. 
        </h3>
<h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100"> what if I don't have their address?
</h2>
        <h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> 
No problem! Just give them the email and password you used to create the subscription. They can sign in and change the address for themselves.

<p id="try-it-free"><h2 class="heading2 text-left border1-bottom color10-bdr margin2-bottom margin2-top width100"> try it free
        </h2>
        <h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100"> what does 'try it free' <i>really</i> mean?
</h2>
<h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> 
Try it free means try it free. When you sign up for this option, you receive a sample of the coffee of your choice free of charge. This option is a free trial entrance into our subscription program, which is why we gather your payment information. We'll send an email reminding you that you've signed up before you're ever charged for anything, so you won't be surprised.
</h3>
<h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100"> how much coffee do you send for free?
</h2>
<h3 class="body-text text-left width100">        
We send four ounces, enough for about nine 12 oz cups of coffee. 
</h3>
<h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100"> when does the free trial expire?</h2>
<h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> 
14 days after you sign up. You have two weeks to decide whether you would like to continue your subscription. Again, we'll remind you before we charge you so you're not surprised (although coffee in your mailbox when you aren't expecting it is a pretty nice surprise :)
        </h3>
<h2 class="heading3 text-left zero width100"> may I try more than one coffee for free?
        </h2>
<h3 class="body-text text-left width100"> 
We want you to find the coffee that works best for you. You can try each of our coffees once for free.
